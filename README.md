A guide to starting with LLM and Agents for software engineers to stay relevant.

## 2. Core Concepts & Tools (The How)

This section dives into the fundamental skills and tools you'll need to effectively work with LLMs and build AI agents.

### 2.1. Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide LLMs and AI agents towards desired outputs. It's a crucial skill for anyone looking to leverage these technologies.

* **[Prompt Engineering Guide (promptingguide.ai)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/):** A comprehensive guide covering the basics of prompting, various techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, ReAct, etc.), and how they apply to both LLMs and AI agents. It also includes information on prompt elements, general tips, and examples.
  * **[Introduction to AI Agents (part of Prompt Engineering Guide)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/agents/introduction):** Explains what AI agents are, why to build with them, their components (planning, memory, tools), and common use cases.
  * **[LLM Agents Research (part of Prompt Engineering Guide)](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/llm-agents):** Delves deeper into the framework of LLM agents, including planning with and without feedback, memory types, tool usage, applications, and evaluation.

Key techniques and concepts to understand:

* **Zero-shot Prompting:** Asking the model to perform a task without any prior examples.
* **Few-shot Prompting:** Providing a small number of examples in the prompt to guide the model.
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Encouraging the model to explain its reasoning step-by-step to arrive at an answer.
* **Self-Consistency:** Generating multiple CoT reasoning paths and choosing the most consistent answer.
* **ReAct (Reason and Act):** A paradigm where agents generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Providing the LLM with external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy.

### 2.2. Interacting with LLMs: APIs and SDKs

Once you understand the fundamentals of prompting, the next step is to interact with LLMs programmatically. This is typically done through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) provided by various LLM developers and platforms.

* **Understanding LLM APIs:**

* **Open Source LLM APIs & Considerations:**
  * **[5 Open Source Large Language Models APIs for Developers (Medium)](https://medium.com/pythoneers/5-open-source-large-language-models-apis-for-developers-0b3b9091b129):** This article discusses APIs/libraries for open-source models like BERT, Llama, PaLM (older version, now Gemini), and BLOOM.
  * Working with open-source models might involve more setup (e.g., using libraries like `transformers` by Hugging Face, `llama-cpp-python` for Llama) and potentially hosting the models yourself, but offers more control and customization.

* **Key Considerations When Choosing an LLM API/SDK:**
  * **Model Capabilities & Performance:** Does the model excel at the tasks you need (e.g., text generation, summarization, coding, reasoning)?
  * **Cost:** Understand the pricing model (per token, per request, etc.) and how it scales with your usage.
  * **Ease of Use & Documentation:** Are the API and SDKs well-documented and easy to integrate into your existing stack?
  * **Rate Limits & Scalability:** Can the API handle your expected request volume?
  * **Security & Privacy:** How is your data handled by the provider?
  * **Community & Support:** Is there an active community or good support from the provider?
  * **Latency:** How quickly does the model respond? This is critical for real-time applications.
  * **Context Window Size:** How much information (text, history) can you pass to the model in a single request?

Understanding and effectively using these APIs and SDKs will be crucial for building powerful LLM-driven applications.
